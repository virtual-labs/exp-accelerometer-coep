### Procedure

#### Prerequisite : 
- Read and understand all instructions and questions provided
- Answer all questions and click on the "Submit Test" button
- Upon successful completion, click on the "Next Level" button which will appear in place of the "Submit" button


#### Simulator :

##### Configuration :
1. Select Accelerometer Type:  Choose the type of accelerometer required for the experiment
2. Select Mass: Choose the desired mass in kilograms (kg) from the available options
3. Select Mass Displacement: Choose the displacement value in centimeters (cm)
4. Select Spring Constant: Choose the spring constant in Newton per meter (N/m)
5. Click the "CHECK CONFIGURATION" button to verify the selected inputs

##### Mimic :
1. Starting the Simulation: Click on the green "START" button
2. Observe the frequency graph that appears on the screen
3. Calculate the natural frequency (in radians per second, rad/s) using the formula:
	         FORMULA : f = √(k/m)
4. Enter the calculated value in the provided textbox and click on the "SUBMIT" button
5. Convert the natural frequency to frequency in Hertz (Hz) using the formula:
             FORMULA :  f(Hz) = ω(rad/s) / 2π
6. Enter this value in the respective textbox and click on "SUBMIT"
7. Calculate the acceleration based on the readings obtained
             FORMULA :  Maximum Acceleration = (Natural Frequency)² * Mass Displacement 
8. Enter the calculated acceleration value in the textbox and click on "SUBMIT"
9. Click on the red "STOP" button to end the current simulation
10. Repeat the above steps under Configuration and Mimic a minimum of 5 times to obtain consistent readings


##### Calibration : 
1. After taking 5 readings, refer to the Calibration Graph displayed below the reading table
2. Use the graph to adjust and verify the accuracy of your readings
3. Now select another type of accelerometer

##### NOTE: Follow steps of "Configuration", "Mimic" for another type of
