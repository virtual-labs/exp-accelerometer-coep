### Procedure

##### Prerequisite : 
- Answer all the questions and click on "Submit Test" button.
- Click on Next level.

##### Simulator :
1. Select mass (kg), mass displacement (cm), spring Constant (N/m)
2. Click on. check configuration button.
3. Calculate natural frequency (rad/s) as per selected values by using below formula
         FORMULA : f = √(k/m).
4. Entered calculated natural frequency and click on submit button. 
5. Above calculated frequency is in rad/sec so, convert it into Hz. by using below formula
        FORMULA :  f(Hz) = ω(rad/s) / 2π
6. Entered converted frequency and click on submit button. 
7. Calculated maximum acceleration by using  below formula
       FORMULA :  Maximum Acceleration = (Natural Frequency)² * Mass Displacement 
8. Entered calculated maximum acceleration and click on submit button. 
9. Click on START button shown in MIMIC  and observe the acceleration and graph.
10. Click on STOP button. 
11. Follow the same steps for next readings.
